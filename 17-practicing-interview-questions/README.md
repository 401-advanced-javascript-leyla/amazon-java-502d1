Finding good practice interview problems can be hard. Where should you begin?!
How do you know if the question you're being asked is a "good" question?

Here's one persons candid opinion about the websites listed under **Resources**
above. Advent of Code is my favorite.

#### Advent of Code
In short: excellent resource with interesting story problems. It does not
provide you with canonical solutions, but there's communities dedicated to
discussing solutions. Advent of Code is programming-language agnostic. It
does not run your code. You write and run code on your own machine then copy
and paste an answer for it to verify on the website.

#### Geeks for Geeks
I've seen this site popping up more and more. It offers lots of good problems,
especially for data structures and it provides solutions. It does a good job of
describing algorithms to solve problems. Most solutions are written in `C` (or
something) so you may not see solutions in your preferred programming language.

#### Code Wars
Here's a website with a vast variety of problems! Problems are categorized with
difficulties. It allows you to write code and execute your solution on their
own website. They have sample input and test cases configured so you know for
sure when your solution is correct or incorrect.

Code Wars's variety is its strength and it's weakness. You may find esoteric
problems that are strangely written or force you to perform exotic tasks. For
instance, this problem asks you to produce a certain output and then it asks
you to try to compress your source code to be less then 100 characters. These
kinds of problems are fun and interesting, but they definitely don't have you
practicing wholesome fundamental programming techniques.

Code Wars is great but it can be hard to tell if you're working on an actually
good problem, or if you're being sent on a bat-crazy fools quest.

* [Human Readable Time (normal problem)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52685f7382004e774f0001f7)

* [Number Triangle (crazy problem!)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59c27053dcc40582a90000f0)

#### Project Euler
In it's own words

```
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the
use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most
problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide
a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new
concepts in a fun and recreational context.
```

Project Euler is a great bank of problems. The one thing I don't like about it
is some of the problems get too mathy and I simply don't like them. Maybe you
do!

For example one problem asks you to find the 1001st prime number. Ok,
I understand that and it makes sense. Other ones simply talk very mathy about
things I don't quite understand and absolutely don't find interesting.

So, Project Euler is a good resouce, but I just don't personally like the
genre. Remember, this is an opinionated text you're reading!

* [Special Pythagorean triplet](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)
* [Highly divisible triangular number](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)
* [Longest Collatz sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)
* [Amicable numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=21)

## Advent of Code
First things first: I want to point out that Advent of Code is an awesome
resource. I can't praise this place enough. The website presents you with
sequential challenges where you have to solve each one before you're presented
with the next. Working through all the problems is satisfying.

Advent of Code is language-agnostic. It doesn't care what programming language
you use to derive your solutions. In fact, Advent of Code doesn't execute your
code. It presents you with a story problem, asks you for an answer and verifies
your solution. It's up to you to interpret how to approach each problem and
what data structures (or programming language!) is the right tool for the job.

Each challenge is split in to two parts. Usually the first half gets your set
up with the basic idea of the problem so you have a chance to program
a foundation. Then the second half adds a twist. You have to modify your first
half somehow in order to find the solution to the second half. Sometimes the
modifcation is simple. Sometimes you find you have to rewrite the entire thing!

The two-part challenge approach is not uncommon in real-world interviews.
Someone may present you with a problem, see if you can solve it, then add
a complication and see how you modify your original solution to solve the new
twist.

# General Practice Tips
Here are some tips for preparing for interviews.

## Review Every Problem You've Ever Seen
If you've taken a class with data structures and algorithms gather up every
problem you've ever been presented with and work through them all again. Most
importantly: work through them using only pen and paper! DO NOT use your
computer when you're practicing. Force yourself to rely on what you remember
without sporadically lookings things up online. Build the muscle memory of
writing out your programming language by hand.

## Look Up "Interview Questions"
Now that you've practiced every problem you've ever seen it's time to broaden
your horizons. Fire up your search engine and look for variations of
"programming interview questions."

Use your best judgement about what constitutes a good problem, or problems
you're interested in solving. Some problems might be too mathy. Some problems
might be ill-defined. Some problems might be asking you to perform algorithmic
acrobatics you don't even want to acknowledge. Sometimes you'll find a problem
that makes total sense in the problem statement, then when you look at the
example solution code you can't make heads or tails of what they're doing.
Through all your results you'll be sure to find at least some new problems 
and solutions that expand your horizons.

## Go Out and Take Interviews
Nothing beats real-world experience. Apply to companies, talk on phones, join
video chats. See what people are actually asking during job interviews.

You're bound to face problems you can't solve. Hopefully you'll be able to take
something away from those ones. You're bound to have problems that you crush!
You're bound to find those goldilocks problems that offer a perfect challenge.

## Talk to Your Peers
It's fun and beneficial to swap war stories with your peers. Make it a point to
talk to your peers to hear how their real-world interviews go, hear what sort
of problems they've been asked and be sure to share your experiences too. If
you have a good group of friends all looking for jobs you can scope out what
sort of questions everyone is asking these days much more broadly than you can
alone!

## Rinse and Repeat
Do all these things over and over again!
