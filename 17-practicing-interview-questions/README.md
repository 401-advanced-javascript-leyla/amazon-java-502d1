Finding good practice interview problems can be hard. Where should you begin?!
How do you know if the question you're being asked is a "good" question?

## Advent of Code
First things first: I want to point out that Advent of Code is an awesome
resource. I can't praise this place enough. The website presents you with
sequential challenges where you have to solve each one before you're presented
with the next. Working through all the problems is satisfying.

Advent of Code is language-agnostic. It doesn't care what programming language
you use to derive your solutions. In fact, Advent of Code doesn't execute your
code. It presents you with a story problem, asks you for an answer and verifies
your solution. It's up to you to interpret how to approach each problem and
what data structures (or programming language!) is the right tool for the job.

Each challenge is split in to two parts. Usually the first half gets your set
up with the basic idea of the problem so you have a chance to program
a foundation. Then the second half adds a twist. You have to modify your first
half somehow in order to find the solution to the second half. Sometimes the
modifcation is simple. Sometimes you find you have to rewrite the entire thing!

The two-part challenge approach is not uncommon in real-world interviews.
Someone may present you with a problem, see if you can solve it, then add
a complication and see how you modify your original solution to solve the new
twist.

# General Practice Tips
Here are some tips for preparing for interviews.

## Review Every Problem You've Ever Seen
If you've taken a class with data structures and algorithms gather up every
problem you've ever been presented with and work through them all again. Most
importantly: work through them using only pen and paper! DO NOT use your
computer when you're practicing. Force yourself to rely on what you remember
without sporadically lookings things up online. Build the muscle memory of
writing out your programming language by hand.

## Look Up "Interview Questions"
Now that you've practiced every problem you've ever seen it's time to broaden
your horizons. Fire up your search engine and look for variations of
"programming interview questions."

Use your best judgement about what constitutes a good problem, or problems
you're interested in solving. Some problems might be too mathy. Some problems
might be ill-defined. Some problems might be asking you to perform algorithmic
acrobatics you don't even want to acknowledge. Sometimes you'll find a problem
that makes total sense in the problem statement, then when you look at the
example solution code you can't make heads or tails of what they're doing.
Through all your results you'll be sure to find at least some new problems 
and solutions that expand your horizons.

## Go Out and Take Interviews
Nothing beats real-world experience. Apply to companies, talk on phones, join
video chats. See what people are actually asking during job interviews.

You're bound to face problems you can't solve. Hopefully you'll be able to take
something away from those ones. You're bound to have problems that you crush!
You're bound to find those goldilocks problems that offer a perfect challenge.

## Talk to Your Peers
It's fun and beneficial to swap war stories with your peers. Make it a point to
talk to your peers to hear how their real-world interviews go, hear what sort
of problems they've been asked and be sure to share your experiences too. If
you have a good group of friends all looking for jobs you can scope out what
sort of questions everyone is asking these days much more broadly than you can
alone!

## Rinse and Repeat
Do all these things over and over again!
